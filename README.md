# Vaadin 23 running in Embedded Jetty using Maven

A demo project showing the possibility of running a Vaadin 23 app from an
embedded Jetty, as a simple `main()` method. Uses [Vaadin Boot](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot).

Both the development and production modes are supported. Also, the project
demoes packaging itself both into a flatten uberjar and a zip file containing
a list of jars and a runner script. See "Packaging for production" below
for more details.
